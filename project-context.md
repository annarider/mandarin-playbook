## Business-Critical Areas to Focus On

1. **Content management** — How easy is it to add new activities? Can non-technical contributors add content? What's the workflow?

2. **Mobile performance** — Load times, mobile UX issues. Parent needs to scan a card in <30 seconds during active play.

3. **Activity variety & organization** — How is content structured? Can we easily filter by age, activity type, difficulty? Is there a risk of repetitive content?

4. **Expansion paths** — What would it take to add Cantonese? Progress tracking? Audio pronunciation guides?

5. **Maintainability** — Since parent has limited time, how complex is it to update or fix issues?
